# chess-dojo

This repository contains the code for [ChessDojo](https://www.chessdojo.club).

This is a mono-repo and contains both the frontend and backend code. Code shared between both frontend and backend is located in the `common` directory.

The frontend is a NextJS app written in TypeScript, while the backend is written in Golang and TypeScript and deployed to AWS Lambda using the [Serverless framework](https://www.serverless.com/) v3.
